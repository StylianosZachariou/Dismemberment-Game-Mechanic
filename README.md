# Dismemberment Game Mechanic

### Background

The goal of this project was to create a re-usable game mechanic in the Unreal Engine. To achieve this result both scripting in C++ and Blueprints were used.

### The Game Mechanic

The game mechanic created is a Dismemberment mechanic. The player is able to pop off their head and arms and move them around the stage.

Using the head the player is able to posses other characters with different abilities. The two abilities characters included are the jumping character, able to jump extremely high,

and the strong character, able to push moving objects if all three limbs are connected to it.
